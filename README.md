## 🧭 Overview  
This project explores the **TCMP-300 (Traditional Chinese Medicinal Plant)** dataset — a large-scale resource designed to support AI-based medicinal plant recognition.  

The dataset contains metadata for **300 species** used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, including scientific (Latin) names, plant families, and image counts for model training and validation.  

The goal of this project is to:
- Summarize the dataset structure  
- Visualize its botanical diversity  
- Discuss its potential applications in pharmacognosy and biomedical AI research

## 🧩 Insights  
- The dataset includes **300 unique species** from diverse medicinal plant families.  
- **Asteraceae**, **Lamiaceae**, and **Fabaceae** are among the most common.  
- The average number of images per species is approximately 150–200, providing strong coverage for model training.  
- TCMP-300 supports applications in **automated plant identification**, **pharmacognosy**, and **AI-assisted herbal research**.

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Integrate TCMP-300 species data with chemical and bioactivity databases (PubChem, TCMID).  
- Develop a CNN model for automatic image classification.  
- Extend analysis to connect plant species with known medicinal compounds.
